				<title>What are the standards of science journalism?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Boston globe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/08/10/computer-scientists-have-looked-for-solution-that-doesn-exist/tXO0qNRnbKrClfUPmavifK/story.html&quot;&gt;reported today&lt;/a&gt; on a paper from &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0348&quot;&gt;Arturs Backurs and Piotr Indyk&lt;/a&gt; that shows that any algorithm that computes the edit distance between two strings in sub-quadratic time implies the existence of a sub-exponential time algorithm for SAT on N variables. Since this would in turn imply that P=NP, the result suggests that such an algorithm does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the Globe describes the finding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For 40 years, computer scientists have tried in vain to find a
faster way to do an important calculation known as “edit distance.”
Thanks to groundbreaking work from two researchers at MIT, they now
know the reason they’ve continually failed is because a faster
method is actually impossible to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s how Backurs and Indyk describe their result in the paper’s abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this paper we provide &lt;strong&gt;evidence&lt;/strong&gt; that the near-quadratic running
time bounds known for the problem of computing edit distance &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;
be tight. (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that the subtlety of arguments based on whether P equals NP might be lost on most of the Globe’s readers. On the one hand, the force of the result is contingent on the conjecture that P does not equal NP. On the other hand, it’s not a &lt;strong&gt;mere&lt;/strong&gt; conjecture; computer scientists will certainly act as if a subquadratic algorithm is impossible to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t journalist have a responsibility to report on scientific results accurately? Couldn’t Harnet (the Globe reporter) have written “almost certainly impossible to create” instead of “actually impossible to create”? We wouldn’t tolerate this kind of reporting on, say, whether the wreckage in the Indian ocean belongs to the missing Malaysian Airlines flight; if the authorities say that they strongly suspect it belongs to the missing airplane, that doesn’t license reporters to say that authorities are sure it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;disqus_thread&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES * * */
    var disqus_shortname = &#39;edechter&#39;;
    
    /* * * DON&#39;T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
    (function() {
        var dsq = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;); dsq.type = &#39;text/javascript&#39;; dsq.async = true;
        dsq.src = &#39;//&#39; + disqus_shortname + &#39;.disqus.com/embed.js&#39;;
        (document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;head&#39;)[0] || document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;body&#39;)[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
&lt;/script&gt;

				<title>Boston 311</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After Amy and I bought a condo in the polish triangle neighborhood of
Dorchester two years ago, I began to feel that I should be engaged in
local civic life. I joined the neighborhood civic assocation – the
McCormack Civic Association – started reading the local newspaper
(The Dot News), and gave disappointed looks towards vagrants,
overgrown yards, and other people’s dog’s feces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, my attendance at the association meetings had
lapsed. But I had discovered one form of civic engagement that I
embraced in a persisting way: the city of Boston has a smartphone
application then called “Citizen’s Connect” and now called Bos311
which allows anyone to submit a request for city services by snapping
a picture and writing a brief description. There are two immediately
apparent advantages about this application: first, reports are
geocoded with the GPS location. This means that I don’t have to figure
out the nearest street address and laboriously type it into my
phone. This is especially important during the cold winter
months. Second, I don’t have to deal with the shame of presenting my
petty request in front of a real live city employee. I’m not always a
big believer in the ability of digital technologies to solve big
important problems, but in this case technology is being used to do
what it does best: it makes it just a little easier, a little less
time consuming, a little less risky to do something that had
previously been just a tad too effortful or too awkward or cognitively
taxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably make up a fair share of the Bos311 reports from my part of
the city. When I walk the dog, I look for litter, overgrown lots,
burned out street lights, broken street signs, and I like to think
that I’m bringing a little attention to my part of town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting to the city is not always successful. There are limitations
to the Bos311 application: there is no way to follow up on a report,
see its progress, provide feedback on a case considered closed, edit
its content in case of error, etc. When you encounter these
limitations you have to follow up using the Mayor’s 24-hour hotline
(often helpful, sometimes not, depends on who you get) or the very web
1.0 ticket database portal that is the backbone of the system but
lacks the friendly user interface of the smartphone application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is great that the city is devoting resources to making
applications like Bos311, and Bos311 is clearly a step in the right
direction from the earlier Citizen’s Connect application, but there’s
only so much that can be done by improving UIs. &lt;/p&gt;
